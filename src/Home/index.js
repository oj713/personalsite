                <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! My name is Omi and I'm a fourth-year Computer and Environmental Science major at Northeastern University. I'm passionate about developing intuitive, efficient software applications and thinking about complex problems from user and data-focused perspectives. My backgrounds in climate activism and environmental research drive an interest in sustainability and green tech which I hope to apply to future careers. I have significant work experience in ecological forecasting, teaching, and quality assurance for iOS. This site collates some major pieces from my academic career â€” please use the tabs in the top right corner to explore my work. Enjoy!</p>
